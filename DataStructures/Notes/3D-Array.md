**Three-Dimensional Array or 3D array**


-- 3D array (three-dimensional array) is a data structure that allows you to store data in three dimensions

**syntax:** 
  type arr_name[x][m][n];

A 3D array can be visualized as a cube where each element is accessed using three indices: array[x][y][z], where:

x is the index for the first dimension (depth),
y is the index for the second dimension (row),
z is the index for the third dimension (column).
